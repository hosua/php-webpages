# php-webpages
These scripts use Bootstrap 5, mysql for storing messages and user account information, and of course php/html.

It is a work in progress and currently has a login page, a message board, and a few download pages.

If you would like to see the work being done, you can check out [my website](http://24.184.108.245:421/index.php).
